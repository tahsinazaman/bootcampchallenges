      <p>
        I am a UX designer with a passion for creating user-centric products that are both useful and enjoyable. I have a strong understanding of the UX design process, from user research and analysis to wire-framing and prototyping. I am also proficient in a variety of UX design tools, including Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I grew up in Bangladesh and moved to Malaysia for higher education. After graduating with a degree in Tourism Management from HELP University, I moved to New York City to pursue my dream of becoming a UX designer. Having lived in multiple countries I learned to be a keen observer of human behavior and to appreciate cultural nuances in how people live their lives in different regions of the world. These life experiences have informed the core philosophy behind my approach to UX design: user empathy. I start any project by putting myself in the shoes of the user before jumping into the technical solution-building process. Empathizing with the user and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve is what enables my work to stand apart.

        In this portfolio, you will find case studies of my work on a variety of projects, including websites, mobile apps, and interactive experiences. Each case study provides a detailed overview of the project, from the initial problem to the final solution.

      <p>
        Whether it is in front of clients, colleagues or employers, I am confident in my abilities as a strong communicator and presenter. I am able to articulate my design decisions clearly and concisely. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If we get the chance to work together, you will find that I am a highly motivated and results-oriented UX designer. I am eager to take on new challenges and tackle them as growth opportunities. With my extensive skillset and passionate energy, I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to any UX team.
